**_Description:_** This is a basic card I made as a requirement to our bootcamp. The task in this activity is to copy the design [here](design/desktop-design.jpg) which can also be seen on the design folder.

We are not allowed to use flexbox or grid on this activity which made it a little difficult. This is a very simple activity so it only took me about an hour, yup that's already fast for me.
