## 📝 Description 
This is a basic card I made as a requirement to our bootcamp. The task in this activity is to copy the design on [this image](design/desktop-design.jpg) without using flexbox or grid layout. This is a very simple activity so it only took me about an hour, yup that's already fast for me. I also made sure to apply the active and hover states of some elements as shown on the design.
